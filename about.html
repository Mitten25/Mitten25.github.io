                <p>
                    Hi there, my name is Andrew Radford. Over the past three years I have attended the University of Utah in pursuit of a degree in Computer Science. 
                I chose to study Computer Science after seeing the field's opportunity for ingenuity and discovery. The majority of my current projects involve games
                and web development. My goal for the future is to use my degree to work as a front end engineer or a game design engineer. When I'm not studying or
                working, I enjoy spending time playing video games or working on personal projects. I spend the remainder of my time in the outdoors of Utah Here I 
                like to explore the mountains, either hiking or mountain biking. Some of my other interests include playing, and following, basketball and sand volleyball,
                as well as practicing guitar and listening to music. The purpose of my website is to allow you to get to know me better and share the projects that I 
                have completed or am developing. I have programmed several games, and hope to work on more web based projects in the future. You can find these in detail under the 
                Projects page. If you wish to contact me, you may email me at andrewradford125@gmail.com or call (435) 655-1331
